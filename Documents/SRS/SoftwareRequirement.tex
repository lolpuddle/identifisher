\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of the SRS is to provide a detailed account of all the expected functions
and requirements of the Software system. It will go into detail regarding the system
as a whole, who we expect to use it and any relevant information one would need
to endorse or build the system. Lastly, we will outline both the functional and
non-functional requirements of the project that are necessary for the system's
success. The intended audience of this document is any shareholders that are involved in this
project. This could include, but is not limited to; the investors, developers, managers,
marketers or human resource workers. Every person which is an entity in the aforementioned
list should all take an interest in the details outlined hereafter to ensure every person
has a clear idea of what the software system should do.

\subsection{Scope}
The software system will be named hereafter as IdentiFisher, which is an Android Application.
This system will be a utility application for anyone who fishes, either recreationally or
competivitely. It also will service novice to experienced fishers. Identifisher will allow
the user to give information about a recently caught fish and help to identify what type
of fish it is. From there, it can collect data and track what fish are caught where. We
hope to build a global logging system that will provide percentage catch rates by lake,
educate young, novice fishers and integrate technology into a relatively non-technology field.


\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations}

Same goes for this, anything can be added as needed. I can cite if you wish.

\subsection{Overview}
Thus far we have given a very brief overview of the IdentiFisher application, its intended
use and what we expect a typical user would be. Going forward, we will go into deeper detail
regarding those topics and more. The next section will give far more information regarding
the application and some of the external matters regarding the system. After that, functional
requirements will be listed with non-functional requirements being the last section of this document.

\section{Overall Description}

\iffalse
This is still a rough draft of the overall desciption. If anyone would like to edit/add to this section, feel free.
\fi

\subsection{Product Perspective}

The IdentiFisher application is similar to other applications that, by user request, analyze textual input or images in order to identify an entity. It is independent as it is not intended to be used as part of a larger system; however, it will interface with an online mapping system in order to perform geolocational functions.

\subsection{Product Functions}
The IdentiFisher application will allow the user to input textual or pictorial data representing a specific fish, request an educated prediction of the type of fish described, and request statistical information about fish in a specific location. Secondly, the application must interface with an online mapping system in order to determine the geolocation of the user. The application must also be able to access a collection of data related to fish population statistics. Finally, the application must determine and display reasonable predictions about the type of fish the user has described.

\end{figure}


\subsection{User Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	The IdentiFisher application is intended to be used by novice to experienced fishers who wish to identify captured fish or access geographical fish population statistics.

	\item
	Technologically, an intended user of the application should have access to a device on which they are capable of installing and accessing an application, establishing an internet connection, as well as generating and inputting textual and pictorial data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Since the statistics about a lake are generated by actual users of the application, the method by which data is collected must be subject to integrity constraints. The application must employ a method of data verification before adding it to the statistics available to other users of the application.

	\item
	The application's functionality is constrained by the OS/Software framework on which we are writing, which must be Android/SDK/Java.

	\item
	Although the application does not have any notable budget constraints, there are time constraints to be considered. The Software Requirements Specification must be complete by February 8, 2016. The application must have been thoroughly tested and be fully functional by April 8th, 2016.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions \& Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	An important assumption is that a user of the application is inputting data which represents a real fish and not data that is fake or replicated from another source. This includes inputting images from the internet or simply inputting details about a fish that the user has not actually found in a specific lake.

	\item
	It is also assumed that the user has access to a GPS-enabled mobile device with an internet connection while they are at the location where they have located the fish they wish to identify.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}

\iffalse
Have not determined yet whether there are requirements that we be delayed until the future.

\section{Functional Requirements}
	\textbf{Requirement \#: 1}\\
	\textbf{Description:} The application must accept inputs from the user about the physical specifications of a fish and return an output of what breed of fish the user might have.\\
	\textbf{Rationale: } The application will not be able to give an accurate estimate of what the breed of fish may be without accepting any inputs.

	\noindent\rule{12cm}{0.4pt} \\

	\noindent\textbf{Requirement \#: 2}\\
	\textbf{Description:} The application must be able to access the user's geolocation.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} The geolocation data could help the user identify what breed of fish the user might have because not all fish exist in every lake.\\

	\noindent\rule{12cm}{0.4pt} \\

	\noindent\textbf{Requirement \#: 3}\\
	\textbf{Description:} The application must display the fishing statistics of different bodies of water by the geolocation specified from the user.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} The user should be able to access the information about the statistics regarding the odds of catching certain breeds of fish in the specified body of water. \\

	\noindent\rule{12cm}{0.4pt} \\

	\noindent\textbf{Requirement \#: 4}\\
	\textbf{Description:} The application must allow the user to submit their catch results from fishing.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} The statistics regarding the odds of catching certain breeds of fish in the specified body of water should be accurate and will require constant updates because fish populations could fluctuate over time. \\
